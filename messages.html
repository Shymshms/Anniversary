            <p>Honey,</p>
            <p>
                I know I haven't been the best boyfriend lately, and for that, I'm truly sorry. I realize that I've made mistakes, and I wish I could go back and fix them. I want you to know that I never want to hurt you, and every day, I'm working on being a better person for you. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You are the most precious thing in my life, and I can't imagine a future without you. From the moment I first saw you, I knew there was something special about you. Your smile, your laughter, the way you see the world – it’s all so unique, and it’s what makes me fall in love with you more and more each day.
            </p>
            <p>
                I promise to be more attentive, more loving, and more present. I promise to listen, to care, and to always be there for you, no matter what. I want to make up for the times I let you down and prove to you that I can be the boyfriend you deserve.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know actions speak louder than words, but I hope these words show just how deeply I care for you and how committed I am to making things right. I will spend every day trying to be the person you fell in love with, and I will cherish every moment we have together.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love you more than words can express, Samantha. Thank you for being patient with me and for believing in us. I believe in us, too, and I know we can get through anything as long as we’re together.
            </p>
            <p>Forever Yours,</p>
            <p>Gabe</p>
